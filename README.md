## sortable-select
This sample demostrates drag and drop functionality for multi-select, the core packages are `react-select` and `react-sortable-hoc`, it depends on the PR of `react-select`: [Add index for multi select values #3727](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/3727).  

> **WARNING**: For this sample to work, the above PR is required. You can build your local version and replace `react-select` in `node_modules` to see it work.

This is an elegant solution to add drag and drop function to `react-select`, the solution is from PR [Add a working example of drag-drop sortable MultiSelect values #3645](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select/pull/3645) by [gunn](https://github.com/gunn).  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
